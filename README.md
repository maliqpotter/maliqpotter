# Hi, I'm Gatan 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

As a former IT Support Specialist turned DevOps Engineer, I’m passionate about making software development smoother and more efficient by improving systems and automating processes. My journey in tech has led me to specialize in tools like Docker, Ansible, Prometheus, and Grafana, all of which I use to drive CI/CD and infrastructure automation.

Let’s talk about how we can push the boundaries of DevOps together and make deployment pipelines robust and efficient!
